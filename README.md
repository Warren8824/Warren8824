**Application Support and Access Analyst| Homelab Builder | Python Learner**

I’m building real-world skills through personal projects, a career in IT support, and an honest curiosity for how things work. Whether it’s automating Active Directory in PowerShell or processing my CGM data with Python, I learn by doing — and by documenting the journey for others like me.

## 🛠️ Current Projects

### [**Riverside Lab**](https://github.com/Warren8824/RiversideHomeLab)  
**Windows Server 2025 Homelab** – Active Directory, DHCP/DNS, RRAS, GPOs  
> A fully-documented, multi-site enterprise-style lab built in Hyper-V.

- Simulates a real org with 4 branch offices and detailed OU/GPO structure  
- Explores subnetting, routing, group policies, and shared access via file server  
- Scripts for automation, test user creation, and security groups  
- Ideal playground to reinforce helpdesk knowledge with practical experience  
- Designed to grow with my learning — security, onboarding, and monitoring planned

### [**CGM Data Processor**](https://github.com/Warren8824/cgm-data-processor)  
**Personal Healthcare Data Tool** – Python, Pandas, SQLite  
> A project to organise and process my own glucose monitoring data.

- Built to parse and clean xDrip+ `.sqlite` exports  
- CLI tool using core Python, Pandas, and SQLite  
- Aimed at standardising long-term CGM records for future analysis  
- Still early-stage — paused while I focus on infrastructure learning
