Building practical healthcare data tools while learning software development | Type 1 Diabetic

## About Me
With 18 years of Type 1 Diabetes experience, I'm learning software development to address practical healthcare data challenges. My focus is on understanding and organising continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) data, drawing from my extensive experience as a patient using these systems.

## Current Project
**[CGM Data Processing System](https://github.com/Warren8824/cgm-data-processor)** (Learning Project)
- Developing a system to organise and standardise CGM data from multiple devices
- Learning to implement proper file organisation and data structures
- Working with SQLite databases and CSV exports
- Creating documentation for future expansion

## Technical Learning
Currently developing skills in:
