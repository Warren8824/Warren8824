**IT Support Engineer | Homelab Builder | Python Learner | Type 1 Diabetic**

I’m building real-world skills through personal projects, a career in IT support, and an honest curiosity for how things work under the hood. Whether it’s automating Active Directory in PowerShell or processing my CGM data with Python, I learn by doing — and by documenting the journey for others like me.
